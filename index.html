                    <h5 class="card-title">The Golden Temple</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">The Golden Temple, also known as Sri Darbar Sahib and Sri Harmandir Sahib, is
                        located in the Indian city of Amritsar in India. The temple is the principal place of worship
                        for the Sikh people, allowing equal entry to all casts, creeds, and races. The temple is part of
                        a larger complex organized around an artificial pond, or sarovar, on which it appears to float,
                        connected by a long causeway to the surrounding structures. The Golden Temple of India's more
                        formal name, Harmandir, comes from the combination of its architect, Guru Arjan Sahib, with
                        "Hari" or "god" and "mandre," meaning "house." As it is alternately called Darbar, meaning
                        "assembly hall," The original structure was built in the late 1500s. However, it was
                        reconstructed after damage from Afghan invaders, with its surface covered in gilt and gold foil.
                        This covering has granted it its more general name, the Golden Temple.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">In the Ramayana, when Jatayu witnesses Ravana abducting Goddess Sita, he
                        courageously endeavors to rescue her from the clutches of Ravana. Jatayu engages in a fierce
                        battle with Ravana, displaying remarkable valor.However, owing to Jatayu’s advanced age, Ravana
                        soon gains the upper hand.
                        As fate would have it, Lord Rama and Lakshmana happen upon the grievously wounded Jatayu in
                        their relentless search for Sita. Jatayu, on the brink of life, informs them that Sita had been
                        taken southward. Sensing Jatayu’s impending departure, Lord Rama drives an arrow into the
                        ground, summoning the seven sacred rivers, known as Teertha, to grant Jatayu Moksha, or
                        liberation from the cycle of life and death.

                    <p class="card-text">The Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631, to be built in the memory
                        of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died on 17 June that year while giving birth to their 14th child,
                        Gauhara Begum. Construction started in 1632, and the mausoleum was completed in 1648, while the
                        surrounding buildings and garden were finished five years later. The imperial court documenting
                        Shah Jahan's grief after the death of Mumtaz Mahal illustrates
                        the love story held as the inspiration for the Taj Mahal. According to contemporary historians
                        Muhammad Amin Qazvini, Abdul Hamid Lahori and Muhammad Saleh Kamboh, Shah Jahan did not show the
                        same level of affection for others as he had shown Mumtaz while she was alive. After her death,
                        he avoided royal affairs for a week due to his grief and gave up listening to music and lavish
                        dressing for two years. Shah Jahan was enamored by the beauty of the land at the south side of
                        Agra on which a mansion belonging to Raja Jai Singh I stood. He chose the place for the
                        construction of Mumtaz's tomb after which Jai Singh agreed to donate it to the emperor.
